Transforms a markdown file into an HTML presentation.

# Install

    $> gem install markdown_presenter

# Use

    $> markdown_presenter file.md > presentation.html

And then open `presentation.html` in your browser to present.

# How It Works
You __don't have to write any mark-up__ or do anything special to create slides.

Slides are automatically delimited by top-level headers (`h1` tags).

See the [presentation example](http://matstc.github.io/example.html).
