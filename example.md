# Markdown Presenter

A very simple tool to transform a markdown file into an HTML presentation.

You __don't have to write any mark-up__ or do anything special to create slides.

Slides are automatically delimited by top-level headers (`h1` tags).

# How To Install

You can install the gem by running:

    $ gem install markdown_presenter

And then the executable `markdown_presenter` will be in your path.

# How To Use

Just run the executable on a markdown file:

    $ markdown_presenter example.md > example.html

And open the `example.html` file in a browser to start your presentation:
